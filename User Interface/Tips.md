#### Font
1. Work with 1rem or 16px - steve schoger
2. Use lineheight to help make text more attractive. - steve schoger
3. Dont make text completly black! lighten it /use a dark gray(its softer on the eyes) - steve schoger
4. You can saturate text with blue (for coolness) or red (for warmth) - steve schoger
5. giving text a diffrent when selecting for example can cause some slight shifting. Instead make them the same font weight and just use color. - steve schoger
6. 

#### Icons
1. You can make an icon look bigger by putting it in a shape, such as a circle. - steve schoger

#### Buttons
1. When considering alignment such as Left or right for save buttons it really doesnt make much diffrence. Although right alignment can provide some difficulty when it comes to accessibility. It should be placed in a location that makes sense.
2. Delete buttons dont have to be RED. You can make them a more subtle color but add an icon to help make them stand out.

##### Other
1. You can use a light border to help associate items on a page. - steve schoger
